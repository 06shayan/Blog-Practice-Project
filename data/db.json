The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",

      "body": "We all make plans for celebrating our birthdays every year. Most of us invite our friends and celebrate it at our home while many have plans to go on a trip to celebrate the birthday with family and friends. There are many people who love to celebrate their birthdays with poor children or in orphanages. It depends upon the choice of people. Small kids love to celebrate their birthday by inviting their friends and in this way they get a good time to play with them.\n\nMy own experience of a birthday celebration in lockdown\n\nI had celebrated my many birthdays with my family, friends, and relatives. During the lockdown, we could not invite anyone and therefore I celebrated my lockdown birthday in a different manner. I thought to plant some new trees in my garden on my birthday. I spent my time planting trees and every member of my family planted one tree as my birthday gift. Thereafter, I enjoyed the delicious dishes made by my mother and feed the same to squirrels and birds in the garden and the street dogs too. I am a nature lover and therefore I loved celebrating my birthday in the lap of nature.\n\nConclusion\n\nI really loved the way of celebrating my lockdown birthday as it gave me a chance to spend my beautiful day with nature. It was a memorable birthday of my life.\n\nI have brought a long essay giving a beautiful experience of celebrating my birthday. I hope you will find it interesting to read and get an idea of writing essays on this topic.",

      "body": "\"Coding\" is a commonly used term for computer programming. Some people use it interchangeably with programming, while others would argue they are not entirely the same.\n\nBy definition, \"code\" refers to a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. Computers don't understand human language, so over time, humans have created languages that computers can understand. And developers speak to them through those languages.\n\nExamples of coding languages include HTML, GitHub Markdown, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, among many others.\n\nWhen you learn how to code, you'll be able to write instructions for computers to follow. This lets you make websites, applications, and software, and do some other cool stuff.\n\nWhat is Programming?\nIf coding is the act of writing instructions for a computer to follow, what then is programming?\n\nMany developers view programming as a more advanced term than coding, and a lot of others use both words interchangeably.\n\nProgramming still involves writing instructions for the computer to follow, but now data structures and algorithms are important. Some coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and Markdown don't use algorithms and data structures, while others such as JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++ use them heavily.\n\nThis brings up a distinction that many developers make. In the web development industry, many developers don't consider HTML to be a \"programming language\" in a strict sense, because it doesn't perform any logic. It just determines the structure of a website.\n\nOn the other hand, languages like JavaScript, Python, C++, and Java, are all \"official\" programming languages because they handle complex functionalities and interactivity.\n\nSome developers refer to anyone who codes in just HTML and CSS as a coder, and those who code in JavaScript, Java, C++, and other programming languages as programmers.\n\nSo you could say that all programmers are coders, but not all coders are programmers. But not everyone feels this way, so it's important to do your own research and learn the skills before you take a side :)",
